== Using Gruff with Rails

Here are a few samples of how you could use Gruff in a Rails project.

== Setup

In either case, your environment.rb should have

  require "gruff"

You might also want to make a folder with your special fonts called

  artwork/fonts

Some people also have success with copying all the Gruff files to Rails' ./lib folder (for shared hosts that don't have the Gruff gem installed.)

== Usage in Code

I use the gruff_method.rb style, possibly with caching to store the output of the graph on disk.

Carlos Villela sent gruff_controller.rb and gruff_helper.rb, and sets a session variable with the relevant data. This allows you to do a Sparklines-style call to Gruff from a view.
